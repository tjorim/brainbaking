      <description>It never occurred to me that an article like this might be very informative for those interested in knowing how things work in the software engineering industry. Google&amp;rsquo;s related results to &amp;ldquo;10 years in IT industry&amp;rdquo; are rather depressing: &amp;ldquo;what to do after 10 years of experience&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;career options after 10 years&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how to survive industry after 10 years&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;best career path after 10 years&amp;rdquo;. It seems to suggest you&amp;rsquo;re done after &amp;ldquo;grinding to level 10&amp;rdquo; - time to boot up another character build?</description>

      <description>People have an irresistible urge to create. But we often mistake productivity with creativity with really creating. Homo creativus. But is this always a good thing? The best inventions in the world bring great sorrow to millions of people today. Then I started wondering, what if&amp;hellip;
Electricity wasn&amp;rsquo;t invented? Mass production wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible. Everything you use, from your watch to your laptop, stove, to what you&amp;rsquo;re wearing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible.</description>
