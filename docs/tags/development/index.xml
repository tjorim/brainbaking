      <description>It never occurred to me that an article like this might be very informative for those interested in knowing how things work in the software engineering industry. Google&amp;rsquo;s related results to &amp;ldquo;10 years in IT industry&amp;rdquo; are rather depressing: &amp;ldquo;what to do after 10 years of experience&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;career options after 10 years&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how to survive industry after 10 years&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;best career path after 10 years&amp;rdquo;. It seems to suggest you&amp;rsquo;re done after &amp;ldquo;grinding to level 10&amp;rdquo; - time to boot up another character build?</description>

      <description>A lot of people seem to think I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of chef who uses loads and loads of ingredients, combining and layering without thinking twice. We were having a discussion about what to cook for dinner this evening. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;donderdag veggiedag&amp;rsquo;, an initiative from the Belgian EVA VZW to eat a vegetarian meal each thursday, and since I&amp;rsquo;m a vegetarian, it&amp;rsquo;s generally accepted that I should know a lot of good recipes.</description>
